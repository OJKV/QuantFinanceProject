## Stock and option data analytics
#### In current project,  I will  build  a program which could be employed by quantitative analysts  in analysing the stocks and options.  Both stock and option data analysis will be applied for 5 past years of historical data. 

#### For Stock data analysis, program will perform following tasks:
*	Retrieving data of chosen stock through pandas DataReader, and plotting it
*	Give table with statistical analysis and tests of the stock(mean, st.dev, skewness, kurtosis) and plot mean return, volatility and correlation graphs
*	Plotting Moving Average crossover and Stochastic Oscillator to identify closest trading signal. For a short MA we use n=20, for a long n=50.
*	Check profitability of MA crossover and Stochastic oscillator strategies for a current stock. For this reason P&L and Sharpe Ratio will be used as measures of profitability.
